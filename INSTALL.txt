==========================================

1. Ensure all files in the password policy distribution are copied 
   to the Drupal modules/password_policy folder.

2. Enable the password policy module under administer >> modules

3. Grant the proper access to users under administer >> access control

4. From administer >> password policy, add a new password policy and specify
   the constraints for the policy.

   be forced to comply with the policy before the password is accepted.
