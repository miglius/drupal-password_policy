TODO
==========================================
- scope out effects with LDAP module, esp. password changes if supported by the LDAP module.
- install support for postgres 
- allowing whitespace in passwords in relation to the character based constraints needs to be
  thought out more carefully.
- add index to password_policy_users table
- Notification feature:
	- allow for forced prompts of password changes -- change passwords every X days
	- email out notification 5 days (4, 3, 2, 1) before forced password change
	- on forced password change, generate random password and mail out, with URL login to be able to change
	- configuration screen to set password time-out value and redirect to user maintenance screen after user authentication if password has expired
	- configuration option for e-mail notification, number of notifications and time intervals between notifications. Add cron job to check password expiry
	- after Y notifiation attempts where the password is incorrect, set the user account to "blocked" and email the user
- support for password policies per user role allowing for increasing password security based on user role type.
- would be nice to have a dictionary lookup constraint 
- would be nice to have a username constraint to avoid passwords similar to a user account name.
